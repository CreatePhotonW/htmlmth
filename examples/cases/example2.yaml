baselines:
  - # use the case specified by casename when responding to HTTP requests to this host at this path
    host: "abc.com"
    path: "/" # HTTP path
    casename: "example-null-001" # case name
  -
    host: "abc.com"
    # if path is not present, will default to any path
    casename: "example-null-001" # required
    filepath: "example2.js" # keys other then "host", "path", "casename" will be ignored so you can use the same yaml file for baseline and case configuration
  -
    host: "abcd.com"
    # if path is not present, will default to any path
    casename: "example-middle-011" # required
